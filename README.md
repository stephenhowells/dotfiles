![iTerm2](https://raw.github.com/stephenhowells/dotfiles/master/iterm/terminal.png)

### Installation

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/stephenhowells/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
$ sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
$ sh ~/.dotfiles/scripts/install.sh
```

### Pro Tips

1. I use [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com) and you should too.
2. The [Base16 iTerm2](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-iterm2) repository has pretty much any color scheme you'd ever want for iTerm2. I use a tweaked version of the `base16-unikittydark.dark` theme which is included in the `iterm` folder of this repository named `stephen.itermcolors`. Simply import that file into iTerm2 and select it as your color preset.
3. Use [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) for sweet looking ligatures in the terminal.
4. Store all secret files (.netrc, etc‚Ä¶) in the `secrets` folder. They will be ignored by git.
5. In iTerm2 tweak a few key bindings globally or in an individual profile to move the cursor easily between words and lines:

```txt
‚åò‚Üê  "SEND HEX CODE" 0x01  # Move cursor to the beginning of the line.
‚åò‚Üí  "SEND HEX CODE" 0x05  # Move cursor to the end of the line.
‚å•‚Üê  "SEND ESC SEQ"  b     # Move cursor one word back.
‚å•‚Üí  "SEND ESC SEQ"  f     # Move cursor one word forward.
```
