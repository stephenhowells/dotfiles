# üî• Stephen's Dotfiles üî•

> Quickly install a beautiful custom ZSH environment along with Homebrew, rbenv, NVM, Go, Elixir, PostgreSQL, Redis, Yarn, Tmux, and a nice Vim editor. My dotfiles are opinionated and obviously superior. Enjoy.

### Pro Tips

1. I use [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com) and you should too.
2. The [Base16 iTerm2](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-iterm2) repository has pretty much any color scheme you'd ever want for iTerm2. I use a tweaked version of the `base16-unikittydark.dark` theme which is included in the `iterm` folder of this repository named `stephen.itermcolors`. Simply import that file into iTerm2 and select it as your color preset.
3. Use [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) for sweet looking ligatures in the terminal.
4. Store all secret files (.netrc, etc‚Ä¶) in the `secrets` folder. They will be ignored by git.
5. In iTerm2 tweak a few key bindings globally or in an individual profile to move the cursor easily between words and lines:

```txt
‚åò‚Üê  "SEND HEX CODE" 0x01  # Move cursor to the beginning of the line.
‚åò‚Üí  "SEND HEX CODE" 0x05  # Move cursor to the end of the line.
‚å•‚Üê  "SEND ESC SEQ"  b     # Move cursor one word back.
‚å•‚Üí  "SEND ESC SEQ"  f     # Move cursor one word forward.
```
